					<div class="bio">Hi there, my name is Angel. I spent over
						eight months at another shelter, so the nice people here agreed to
						take me and give me a chance at finding my forever home. I am a
						sweet girl with people and have lived with children before. I walk
						very well on the leash and enjoy being outdoors, soaking up the
						sunshine and fresh air. One of my favorite things is to play
						fetch, ill throw a ball with you all day long if you'd let me. One
						way to my heart is through food, you can use treats to train me to
						be the perfect lady. The only thing that I'm not a fan of is other
						animals. I would prefer to be the only dog in the home, I just
						want to be the apple of your eye and not have to share the
						attention with anyone else. On occasion, I have been known to be
						okay with submissive female dogs, but it's best that I will just
						be the only pet in your home to keep everyone happy. I promise
						that if you give me some time, you will realize why all you need
						is me. If you think you can provide me with the home I deserve,
						don't hesitate to call today.</div>

					<div class="bio">Hi, my name is Nala. I was surrendered with
						my puppy but now it's time for me to branch out and find a home of
						my own, somewhere where I can be someone's whole world. I am very
						affectionate and love to cuddle, you'll find that out pretty soon
						when I jump up in bed with you for a mid-day nap! I am very smart
						and eager to learn all sorts of cool tricks. I can sit on command,
						but I really love to show off how smart I am by giving you my paw,
						ill give you my paw over and over until you take it and tell me
						I'm a good girl. I am highly treat motivated so you can teach me
						all sorts of tricks with a few tasty snacks! I get along with
						other dogs but a meet and greet is recommended if you have another
						dog in the home. I am very well-mannered when I walk on the leash
						and enjoy going outdoors for walks to enjoy the fresh air and
						sunshine. If you are interested in meeting me, then give the
						shelter a call today.</div>

					<div class="bio">My name is Road Runner. There is a whole
						story behind my name. If you haven't had a chance to hear my story
						then look on Facebook, I'm a celebrity there! Long story short I
						was dumped at the shelter, and I was so scared that I ran for
						days. Once I was finally in the custody of the nice people here I
						was very fearful and did not know how to act like a dog. I have
						begun to trust the people here but will need time to warm up to
						new people. I am now available for adoption, but there are several
						requirements that my future family will have to meet in order to
						take me home: a sturdy/secure fence, no small children, a yard to
						play in, and a dog companion to keep me company. When I was
						introduced to another dog here, I became the happiest I've ever
						been. Because of this, I must be in a home with another dog so I'm
						not alone when you are away. I am still a bit of a flight risk and
						so my new home must have a very secure yard so I don't have any
						opportunity to escape because if I get out, I will run. The people
						here have gotten very attached to me, but they know my perfect
						home is out there. They will be picky with who I go home to, in
						order to make sure it's the right fit. If you are interested in
						adopting me and meet the requirements then give the shelter a call
						today.</div>

					<div class="bio">Hi, my name is Handsome. It's a name that
						fits me perfectly! Not only am I absolutely adorable, but I've got
						a pretty sweet personality too. I'm very affectionate and can
						often be found snuggling with my person on the couch or in bed...it
						doesn't matter to me! I'm also an active guy who likes to play
						fetch, and I will show you how fast I can run when I get the
						zoomies! I must be the only dog in the home as I can be very
						territorial of my space, there is no exceptions to this rule, but
						I will be the bestest boy for the right family. I promise you'll
						have so much fun with me that you won't mind. I am well-mannered!
						I know how to sit on command, and I walk very well on leash. One
						last thing you need to know about me, the way to my heart is with
						treats, 100%! If you'd like to meet me, give the shelter a call
						today, I'll be patiently waiting!</div>

					<div class="bio">Hi, my name is Alicie. I'm a cute little thing! Don't let my
						sometimes "grumpy" face fool you, I'm petite and sweet! You can
						see that I have inherited some Oriental Shorthair breed features,
						but I didn't get the loud and talkative gene. Most of the time you
						can hardly hear my precious little meow as I talk, but I will talk
						to you softly now and again. I'm very
						gentle-natured and love getting attention more and more as I get
						comfy, so it won't take long for me to settle in! My favorite
						place is on the furniture, so put soft blankets down for me and
						maybe a nice bed on the floor. We will also need a cat tree,
						because I do like to climb to sit up high quite often too! I am
						okay with cats around if they keep their distance from me, because
						I tend to be a bit of a loner around them. I'm nice and will only
						hiss to keep them away, if they get too close. I LIKE NOT BEING
						THE ONLY CAT though, and having good-natured cat company nearby. I'm just
						learning about playing and having fun with them. I really like to play with the wand toy. Let's start
						playing with that together, and both have fun! </div>

					<div class="bio">Hi, my name is Tyson. I'm a very gentle, big, soft hearted boy, just as
						sweet as I can be! I'm shy when we meet, but I come alive when you
						pet me, and the more you pay attention to me, the more relaxed I
						feel! I feel safe
						snuggled up, or hiding under, my favorite squishy blankets.
						Sometimes I might be up high, or burrowing into tight spaces for
						comfort at first, as I did here. I like to climb sometimes and
						sit up high a lot. Look for a big STURDY cat tree with EXTRA LARGE
						platforms to lay on. Once I'm settled, I'm a very friendly guy
						that loves to be around people and can't get enough cuddling or
						pets, ever! I don't mind if you want to pick me up and hold me.
						Hugs are nice and I'm a huge LOVE-BUG! DO NEED
						TO BE IN A FAIRLY QUIET HOME. Too much activity and noise will be
						more than I can deal with. Other pets are okay. We had another
						SWEET CAT ROOMMATE before, just give me some elbow-room! GENTLE,
						QUIET DOGS ARE OKAY too! Our first person said that I make a perfect 
						emotional support animal, because I am so very sweet!</div>
